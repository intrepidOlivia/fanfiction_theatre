            <div class="five columns"><p>Sturgeon's Law posits that 90% of everything is crud, but when it comes to fanfiction, well, I'd wager that ratio gets even steeper. I unironically applaud all those mad lads penning novel-length odes to their blorbos, and some of them are quite talented, but the absurdity of most fanworks cannot be denied, and why should it be? We live in an absurd reality. Let's laugh at the audactiy of amateur artists and delight in the simple joy of malapropism. Let every transformative typo lead us deeper into madness as we shed the opressive pretense of coherent meaning. That's what Fanfiction Theatre is all about, baby! A celebration of naïve writing, in all of its foibles, flaws, and unintentional hilarity.</p></div>
